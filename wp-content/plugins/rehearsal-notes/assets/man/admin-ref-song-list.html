    <p>The Song List is the beginning of the Rehearsal Notes settings.&nbsp; The
      only information it is dependent upon is the list of Directors.&nbsp; The
      list of Directors should not be changed once the Song List has been
      entered, but see <a href="#admin-ref-vp-form">Singers Settings form </a>if
      it does.&nbsp; Everything else is dependent on the Song List.&nbsp;
      Preferably it should never be changed once any Singer's Voice Parts have
      been assigned or any Rehearsal Notes have been created.</p>
    <p class="rm-caution">WARNING: If changes are needed after Voice Parts have
      been assigned or Rehearsal Notes added, see the detailed instructions
      under <a href="topic#changing-song-list">CHANGING THE SONG LIST</a>
      below.</p>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h6>Delete button</h6>
    <p>This is the first column, but is only available for Songs which do not
      have any dependent Rehearsal Notes.&nbsp; See <a href="topic#changing-song-list">CHANGING
        THE SONG LIST</a> for details.</p>
    <h6>Measures</h6>
    <p>The two boxes are for start and end measures.&nbsp; Normally start
      measure is 1, but allows for when a score's numbering does not start at
      1.&nbsp; These numbers are used to validate the starting measure of
      Rehearsal Notes.</p>
    <h6>Voice Parts</h6>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use the same voice parts as in the score</strong>.&nbsp; For
        example, if the score is SAA, use "S,A1,A2".&nbsp; If the Directors want
        the voice parts to be split High/Middle/Low, then on the Singer List
        assign High =&gt; S, Middle =&gt; A1 and Low =&gt; A2.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Only one set of voice parts can be assigned to each song</strong>.&nbsp;
        If the song has more complex voice splits in different places, choose
        the most common for the overall song, and then call out exceptions on
        individual Rehearsal Notes.&nbsp; Another option is create a Rehearsal
        Note that outlines the complex splits.&nbsp; Sometimes its a good idea
        to do both.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Each voice part must be 1-2 characters in length, and unique</strong>.&nbsp;
        If the song has Middle voices for both women and men, use "um" and "lm"
        for Upper and Lower Middle voices.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Voice Parts can use any letter designation that fits with the
          score</strong>.&nbsp; So, for example a twelve part Vaughn-Williams
        piece done in Opus 26 used "S1,Sm,S2,A1,Am,A2,T1,Tm,T2,B1,Bm,B2".</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Voice Parts are displayed in the order they are listed on the
          Song List</strong>.&nbsp; They should be listed high-to-low.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>For</em><span style="color: #272727;"><em> a further explanation of
          how Voice Parts are used by Singers, see <a href="#singer-ref-vp-form">Singers
            Voice Parts form</a></em>.</span></p>
    <h6>Save Changes</h6>
    <p>Please note that changes on this page are not immediately saved.&nbsp;
      You must click on <button type="submit" class="rm-button-admin-primary">
        Save Changes </button> after making changes.</p>
    <h6>Download CSV</h6>
    <p>The <button type="submit" class="rm-button-admin-secondary"> Download
        CSV </button> button is provided as a way to backup the settings, and
      could be used as way for Directors to review the settings and perhaps send
      back changes.&nbsp; There is no "Import CSV", as this would bypass many
      validation checks in the online form, and could introduce incorrect
      settings.</p>
    <h6 id="changing-song-list">Changing the Song List</h6>
    <p>The settings in the song list are used throughout the RN system.&nbsp;
      All of its other settings as well as the Notes themselves depend upon this
      list.&nbsp; So making changes to the list after Voice Parts have been
      assigned or Rehearsal Notes have been written is possible, but should be
      done very carefully.&nbsp; One way to do it safely is to go to the <a href="#admin-ref-admin">Administrator
        Tab</a> and delete all Rehearsal Notes.&nbsp; But this may not be
      desired or necessary.&nbsp; Here is a list of changes that can be done
      without clearing the entire Notes database.</p>
    <p class="rm-caution"> Before making these changes, it is best to save
      current copies of the RN settings and data as described in <a href="#admin-ref-admin">Settings,
        Administrator tab</a>.</p>

            and then have the RN Administrator permanently delete them.&nbsp;
            Then the delete button will become available for the Song and it can
            be removed.<br>

            everywhere: in the Voice Part Assignments, Singer Voice Parts,
            Rehearsal Notes, and in note Histories.&nbsp; Technically the
            history will be "rewritten" as if that was the name all the
            time.&nbsp; But the change itself is harmless.<br>

            measure limits are used are when the Add/Edit form is saved.&nbsp;
            For example: If a note already exists, starting at measure 75, and
            the End Measure is reset to 70, that note will continue to say it
            starts at m75.&nbsp; However, if it is edited, it will not allow the
            edit to be Saved until its start measure is changed to be less than
            71.<br>

            the Director's Inbox.&nbsp; Since changing it does not affect
            existing Questions, they may need to be manually reset. For
            completely adding/removing a Director from the list, see <a href="#admin-ref-singer-list">Settings,

            those that were for "(all)" voice parts.<br>
          </td>
          <td>Adding a Voice Part is safe, but check the Singer List to make
            sure its VP settings are still OK.&nbsp; Voice Part Assignments are
            made 2 ways:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Default settings: these are automatically applied when they
                can be determined.&nbsp; For example, a T1 will have a default
                setting T when it is available in a Song.</li>
              <li>Overrides: when a VP setting has been changed on the Singer
                List, it is an override of the default setting.</li>
            </ol>
            So, when a new VP is added to a Song, if a Singer's VP was using a
            default setting, it may be reset to the new VP if possible.&nbsp;
            But any Overrides will be unaffected.
            <p> <br>
              Its a bit different for Rehearsal Notes.&nbsp; The Note's VPs are
              stored in the note, so this change is not applied to existing
              Notes.&nbsp; Check for Notes that were (all).&nbsp; (all) is not
              an actual VP setting.&nbsp; It is automatically shown when every
              VP has been set for a Song.&nbsp; Now that a new VP has been
              added, those songs that showed (all) will now show just the
              previous list of VPs.&nbsp; You may need to add the new VP to each
              of these Notes, if they should still apply to (all) VPs.</p>

            Assignments and in Notes with this VP.<br>
          </td>
          <td>This has a similar affect in the other direction.&nbsp; Singers
            who were using the removed VP as a default setting (#1 above) should
            get reset to another existing VP, if possible.&nbsp; But those who
            had VP Overrides, even if the Override included the removed VP, will
            be unchanged, and continue to show the remove VP.&nbsp; If you
            modify their VP assignments, the removed VP will no longer be an
            option and will be removed on Save.&nbsp; So after a remove - check
            and adjust the settings in Singer List.<br>
            <br>
            Same for Rehearsal Notes.&nbsp; Notes for that Voice Part will be
            unchanged.&nbsp; You should go through those notes, edit and save

            around), so both of the above instructions will need to be
            applied.&nbsp; In fact, it is probably wiser to them separately one
