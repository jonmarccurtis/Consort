<br>      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">This can be useful when the same note must        be created for a set of measures, or is for both choirs of a song that        has two entries in the Song List, for Choir 1 and Choir 2.</div>    </div>    <br>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span class="genericon-time"></span><strong>History</strong>      - Brings up the History Log for the Q/N.&nbsp; <br>      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a recording of the entry and every        modification of the Q/N.<br>      </div>      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Sometimes it can help to understand who        processed a note, when, and how it ended up where it is.</div>    </div>    <br>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span class="genericon-edit"></span><strong>Highlight</strong>      - In some other <a href="#navigate-tables">Common Tables</a>, it is      possible to click on a row to <span class="master_row rn-selected">&nbsp;highlight&nbsp;</span>      it.&nbsp; <br>      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">In this table, clicking a row brings up        the <a href="#nt-ref-add-form">Edit form</a>, so this action button is        provided, as an alternative, to do the highlighting.&nbsp; It is useful        when changing the Preset, filtering, or sorting.&nbsp; It marks row(s)        so that they can be found after the change.&nbsp; <br>        There are some actions that automatically highlight rows.&nbsp; For        example, if you use the Location quick drop-down to change a Q/N to a        location outside of the current filter, it will be hidden (but also        highlighted).&nbsp; You can then change the filter and find it, because        it will remain highlighted.&nbsp; <br>        Clicking this action button enables you to manually select which row(s)        to highlight.</div>    </div>    <br>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span class="genericon-trash"></span><strong>Permanently        Delete</strong> - <em>This is only available to the RN Administrator</em>.<br>      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">It only appears for those Q/N already set        to location = "Trash".&nbsp; It serves only as a cleanup option.&nbsp;        In the rare case when a Q/N was really a mistake and there is no point        in keeping it in the historical records, it can be completely removed        using this action button.&nbsp; This action cannot be undone.</div>    </div>  </body></html>
