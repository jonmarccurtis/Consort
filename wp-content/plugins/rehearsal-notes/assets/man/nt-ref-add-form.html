    <small><em>Only on</em>: <strong><span class="rm-color" style="color: #0433ff;">Ask
          Question for Directors<br>
        </span></strong></small>When a Note Taker needs to enter a question
    asked by another Singer, their name is entered here.&nbsp; This is so that
    the Directors know who the question came from, the staff knows where to send
    an answer to the question if needed, and the Singer is able to use their <span
      class="rm-button">
      TRACK QUESTIONS </span> form to find its status.<br>
    <h6>EDITING A PUBLISHED NOTE, already copied (done &gt; 0)</h6>
    <small><em>Only on</em>: <strong style="color: #0433ff;">Edit Published
        Rehearsal Note</strong> (when Done count &gt; 0)</small><br>
    This condition is indicated at the top of the form with:<br>
    <em style="color: #880000;"><small>You are editing a Published Note that has
        been read/copied.&nbsp; These settings can no longer be changed...</small></em><br>
    If a Note has already been copied into scores, then only its content can be
    edited.&nbsp; All of its "identifying information" must remain the same, so
    that Singers will know exactly which note has been changed.&nbsp; The note's
    content should be rewritten in way that makes it clear:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a modification of an earlier marking.</li>
      <li>What the previous marking was, and how it should now be modified or
        removed.</li>
      <li>Consider adding [Modified] at the beginning of the content.</li>
      <li>Consider using a strike-out font over the <span style="text-decoration:line-through">previous
          content that has changed</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    When a Published Note is modified and Saved, a dialog will appear asking
    whether to clear everyone's "Done" status.&nbsp; Normally you should click
    on "OK" to do this.&nbsp; It returns the Note to a Singer's "My notes" list,
    and lets them know that this is a change they need to update in their
    scores.&nbsp; However, there may be some cases where it is not necessary,
    for example:
    <ul>
      <li>The changes only enhance the description of the Note, but do not
        change what needs to be marked.</li>
      <li>The Note was only reformatted for easier reading, and the marking to
        be made has not changed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes changes are needed in a Published &amp; marked Note's
      "identifying information":</p>

    <h6>SONG DROP DOWN</h6>
    <p>This should always be set first.&nbsp; It then establishes the range of
      allowed measures, the Section (Voice Parts) list, and the default
      Director.&nbsp; If this is changed later, you need to recheck these
      settings.</p>
    <h6>MEASURE BOX</h6>
    Enter the starting measure for the Q/N.&nbsp; The possible range for this
    song is listed below the box and is used to validate the measure entered.
    <ul>
      <li>If the Q/N refers to the entire song, leave this blank.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>If the Q/N is for a range of measures (3-10), put the starting measure
        in this box, then indicate the range in the content.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>If this is a question for a set of measures (3,15,31) then put the
        first measure in the box and indicate the list of measures in the
        Question.&nbsp; </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Once the question has been answered, divide the Note into separate
          Notes for each measure using the <span class="genericon-document"></span>Duplicate
          button.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h6>Section</h6>
    <p>This shows a list of possible voice parts for the song.&nbsp; The ones
      the Q/N pertains to should be highlighted in <span style="color:white;background-color:#3b88fd">&nbsp;blue&nbsp;</span>.&nbsp;
      Click on each to turn them on/off.</p>

    The Location Drop Down behaves differently depending on the form and current
    location of the Q/N.&nbsp; These settings help to maintain the process
    order: Question &gt; Note &gt; Review &gt; Published or Trash, while still
    allowing for reasonable flexibility and undo.<br>

    <h6> Director DROP DOWN</h6>
    <p>This defaults to the Director assigned to the Song in the <a href="#admin-ref-song-list">Settings,
        Song List</a>.&nbsp; But it can be overridden if needed.&nbsp; For
      example, sometimes questions about voice part assignments need to be
      redirected from a guest director to Allan.</p>
    <h6>Q/N Content Edit Box</h6>
    <p>This is where the contents of the Q/N are entered or edited.&nbsp; The
      "Add Media" button should be avoided or only used for very small images
      that support the note.&nbsp; The "Text" tab should only be used by those
      who know HTML.</p>

    <h6>Discussion Edit Box</h6>
    <p>This box is for private RN Staff questions and discussions about a Q/N
