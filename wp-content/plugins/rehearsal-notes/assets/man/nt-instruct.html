  <body>Note Takers are those who have volunteered to record changes in the
    music given by the Directors at Workshops.&nbsp; These are the instructions
    on how to enter those "rehearsal notes" online.<br>
    <h6>Edit Rehearsal notes page</h6>
    <p><strong>Location</strong>: Admin -&gt; Edit Rehearsal Notes<br>
      <strong>Direct Link</strong>: <a href="https://www.consortchorale.org/rehearsal-notes-admin" target="_blank:">https://www.consortchorale.org/rehearsal-notes-admin</a><br>
      If you do not see this menu item, ask the RN Administrator to add you to
      the Note Takers list.</p>
    This page contains all rehearsal notes and questions in a single
    table.&nbsp; Each Q/N has a location, which also defines a work-flow order:
    <table class="print-table" style="width: 100%;" border="1">

    </table>
    <p>You can use the "<strong>Presets</strong>" drop-down at the top of the
      page, to filter the table on the above locations.</p>
    <h6>SUGGESTED WORKFLOW</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Set <strong>Presets</strong> to "All Notes".</li>
      <li>(optional) Filter to the Song you are working on by entering its name
        in the filter at the top of the "Song" column.</li>
      <li>Check for Duplicates</li>
      <ol>
        <li>The notes are sorted by start measure (ms) by default.</li>
        <li>If you put a measure number into the "ms" filter, it will show +/-
          10 measures.</li>
        <li>You can click the <span class="genericon-time"></span>clock icon on
          the right of any note to see its complete history.</li>
        <li>If you find a duplicate already entered, set its location = "Trash".</li>
        <li>You can email a note's last Editor by clicking on their name.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Use <span class="rm-button"> ADD NOTE </span> or <span class="rm-button">
          ASK QUESTION </span> buttons to enter your information.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If asking a question from another singer, select their name in the "<strong>On
            behalf of</strong>" drop-down, so they can find the question in
          their <a href="#singer-ref-track-questions-form">Track
            Questions form</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h6>Additional Information</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>If any other RN staff are currently online, their name(s) will be
        outlined in <span class="staff-name" style="outline-color:blue;">blue</span>,
        and any changes they make will appear immediately on your page, briefly
        <span class="staff-name" style="outline-color:blue;">outlined in blue</span>.</li>
      <li>Notes you enter are set to location = For Review.&nbsp; The ideal
        process is that each note will be reviewed by another Note Taker or the
        Administrator before going out to the singers, which is location =
        Published.</li>
      <li>Notes and Questions can be modified at any time, unless they have been
        Published and at least one Singer has marked them "Done".&nbsp; Then,
        further editing is limited, and should only be done in a way that those
        singers who have already recorded the markings in their music will know
        what needs to now be changed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Suggestions when creating notes</h6>
    [seg-rnote-format]
    <br>
    <strong>Not all Questions need to become Notes, or forwarded to Directors</strong><br>
    If a question can be answered without needing to make a change/marking in
    the music:
    <ol>
      <li>Email the Singer asking the question, sending them the answer</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Click on the <span class="genericon-time"></span>clock icon to the
          right of the question</li>
        <li>In the first revision, click on the "Author" name to start an email
          to them</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Set the question's location = Trash</li>
      <ol>
        <li>In the Trash form, add the answer sent to the singer.</li>
        <li>This keeps a log of the answer in case it is asked again.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <strong>When a song has 2 choirs (Choir1 and Choir2)</strong><br>
    These songs will have 2 entries in the Song list.&nbsp; If a question/note
    refers to both choirs:
    <ol>
      <li>Add it to one of the choir's song entries.</li>
      <li>Click on the <span class="genericon-document"></span>Duplicate icon
        in the right-hand column.</li>
      <li>Change the duplicate to be for the other choir.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note refers to the entire song</strong><br>
      Leave the (start) measure blank.</p>
    <p><strong>Note refers to a range of measures</strong> (12-16)<br>
      Only enter the starting measure.&nbsp; "Measure" is only used for sorting
      the notes in the table.&nbsp; The full range of measures, or the ending
      measure, can be indicated in the note's text.</p>
    <strong>Note refers to a non-contiguous set of measures</strong> (12,18,25)
    <ol>
      <li>Enter it for the first measure</li>
      <li><span class="genericon-document"></span>Duplicate for the additional
        measures</li>
    </ol>
