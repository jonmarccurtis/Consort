This drop-down provides several prebuilt options:    <ul>      <li><strong>- clear sorting &amp; filters -</strong>: Removes all filters        and sorting.&nbsp; This setting also removes the default sorting, which        is by Song and Starting measure.<br>        <strong></strong></li>      <li><strong>MY NOTES, NOT DONE (Rec)</strong>: This is the recommended        setting.&nbsp; </li>      <ul>        <li>It shows notes for your assigned voice part(s) which do not have the          "Done" check box checked.&nbsp; </li>        <li>In other words, it shows only the notes you have yet to mark in your          score.</li>      </ul>      <li><strong>My notes, Done</strong>: Shows notes for your assigned voice        part(s) that you have completed (checked "Done").</li>      <ul>        <li>It can be used to find and fix a note that you accidentally checked          "Done"</li>      </ul>      <li><strong>My notes (all)</strong>: Shows all notes assigned to your        voice part.</li>      <li><strong>All notes</strong>: Complete list of all Rehearsal Notes,        including those for other voice parts.</li>      <ul>        <li><strong>- All notes, Not Done</strong>: Complete list of all Notes          which you have not checked the "Done" checkbox</li>        <li><strong>- All notes, Done</strong>: Complete list of all Notes that          you have checked the "Done" checkbox for</li>      </ul>    </ul>    <p class="rm-hint">Hint: you are only required to mark notes for your own      voice parts, but it can be a good practice to also include markings for      other voice parts.</p>    <strong><em>Shift-click</em>: Sort multiple columns</strong>: Columns can be    sorted by clicking on their dark red header cell.&nbsp; Shift-click enabled    a sort using more than one column. <br>    <h6>ASK QUESTION BUTTON</h6>    <p>The <span class="rm-button"> ASK QUESTION </span>button brings up the <a        href="#singer-ref-ask-question-form">Ask        Question form</a> which enables Singers to ask questions of the      Directors outside of rehearsals/workshops.</p>    <h6>TRACK QUESTIONS BUTTON</h6>    <p>When you ask a question it follows a process through the Rehearsal Notes      staff, resulting in either an answer back, or a Rehearsal Note being      created.&nbsp; Typically it follows this order: Ask Question &gt; Note      Takers' Inbox &gt; Director's Inbox &gt; For Review &gt; Published.&nbsp;      If you have asked any questions, clicking the <span class="rm-button">        TRACK&nbsp;QUESTIONS </span>button will bring up the <a href="#singer-ref-track-questions-form">Track        Questions form</a> shows where they are in the process and who is      currently assigned to them.&nbsp; It also provides a way for you to email      the staff if you have additional information about a question you have      asked.</p>    <h6>PRINT BUTTON</h6>    This is for those who prefer to mark their scores from paper instead of    online.&nbsp; The recommended way to do this is:    <ol>      <li>Set Presets = "MY NOTES, NOT DONE (Rec)"</li>      <li>Click the <span class="rm-button"> PRINT </span>button</li>      <ol>        <li>This opens a page with the same set of notes, formatted for          printing, including a "Done" column to manually check with a pencil.</li>      </ol>      <li>Use your browser's print button to print the page</li>      <li>IMPORTANT: Once the print is successful, <em>click the </em><button          class="button rm-button-no-shadow">Set&nbsp;all&nbsp;Done</button><em>          button!</em></li>      <li>Use the printed copy to mark your scores.</li>    </ol>    <p class="rm-caution">Each time you make a printed copy of the notes in this      way, that printed copy should be considered your official set of notes to      mark in your score, even if you do not get them marked in your score right      away.&nbsp; By setting them all "Done" at printing time (step #4) you are      insuring that any new or modified notes will show up online the next time      you load the Rehearsal Notes page.&nbsp; Your next printing will include      only the new things you need to mark, since your last printing.</p>    <h6>View Voice Parts, Adjust "My Note" filter</h6>    <p>At the top of the table on the left, is a link labelled: <span style="color:#880000;font-size:11px">View        Voice Parts, Adjust "My note" filter</span>.<br>      Some music can have very complex (12+) voice parts.&nbsp; It becomes      difficult to scan through the Notes and figure out which ones pertain to      your voice part(s).&nbsp; The "My Note" filter is designed to do this for      you.&nbsp; It compares the voice parts a note is targeting with the voice      parts you have been assigned.&nbsp; When there is match an X appears in      the "My note" column.</p>    <p>Your Voice Part Assignments are set by the Directors, but there may be      cases where you are interested to know about markings for other voice      parts, or your voice parts have been changed, but not yet updated      online.&nbsp; The <a href="#singer-ref-vp-form">View Voice Parts form</a>      is where you can see what parts the Directors have assigned you to, and      enables you to override those settings.</p>    <p><strong><em>Click row</em>: Highlight (<em>alt-click multiple</em>)</strong>:      Sometimes you may want to keep track of one or more notes while changing      sorting or filtering.&nbsp; You can click on rows to highlight them and      those rows will remain highlighted through the sort/filter change.&nbsp;      When you click a "Done" box, its row is automatically highlighted.&nbsp;      If you clicked by mistake, you can change the filtering and find the      highlighted row to fix it.</p>    <h6>TABLE Columns</h6>    <p class="rm-hint">Hint: Clicking on some Column header cells will sort the      column.&nbsp; Shift-click can sort multiple columns.&nbsp; The second      header row contains filters.&nbsp; If more than one filter is created they      are combined and only those rows that match all the filters are shown.</p>    <strong>Done</strong><br>    This column provides a check box so you can indicate that you have marked    your score with this note.&nbsp;&nbsp; These markings are kept on the    server, even if you log out and back in again, or access the list from a    different device.&nbsp; <br>    <div class="rm-caution"> <em>It is important to check the "Done" boxes!</em>      <ul>        <li>It enables you to filter out completed notes, and only see the          new/modified ones you need to mark.</li>        <li>It lets the Directors know how complete we are in having scores that          are correct.</li>        <li>If a note you have marked "Done" needs to be modified, its "Done"          mark is removed so it will reappear in your notes to mark.</li>      </ul>    </div>    <br>    <strong>Song</strong>    <p>You can enter all or part of a song name in its filter, to work with only      one song at a time.</p>    <strong>ms</strong>    <p>This is the starting measure for the notes.&nbsp; It is used for sorting      and can also be used for filtering.&nbsp; Its filter only accepts a singe      measure number, but will show notes within +/-10 measures.</p>    <p><strong>My note</strong><br>      An X appears in this column when one or more of the note's target voice      parts match your assigned voice parts.&nbsp; Its filters can be: (empty) =      show all notes, 'X' = show only my notes, '!X' = show only notes that are      not mine.</p>    <p><strong>Parts</strong><br>      This column shows the Voice Part(s) that a note is for.&nbsp; You can      place multiple Voice Parts in its filter, but it will only show notes that      are for all the voice parts in the filter.&nbsp; For example: SA will only      show notes that are for both Soprano and Alto.&nbsp; It is not possible to      create a filter in this column that will show notes for either Soprano or      Alto, but one could set their "My Notes" filter to do this.</p>    <p><strong>Rehearsal Note</strong><br>      Shows the note's content.&nbsp; It cannot be sorted, but can be filtered      similar to "search".</p>  </body></html>
