  <body> Consort has the tradition of not asking questions about the music
    during rehearsals, and limiting the amount of time spent in rehearsals going
    over changes to the music. Instead, changes to the music are posted on this
    page of the website and it is each singer’s responsibility to copy those
    changes to their music.<br>
    <br>
    <b>“Done” checkbox:</b><br>
    It's important that you use this checkbox for several reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Notes are added continuously throughout the season. When you check off
        what you’ve already added to your music, you can quickly identify which
        notes are new, and needed to copied.</li>
      <li>If a note you have already marked in your music must be changed, your
        “Done” checkmark will be removed so that you know to update that
        marking.</li>
      <li> Marking a note “Done” lets Note Takers know that they must limit what
        they can change in the note.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Presets dropdown:</b><br>
    This defaults to showing only "My Notes", but most of the time you may want
    to use "- MY NOTES, NOT DONE (Rec)", which will show only your notes that
    you haven’t yet marked in your music.<br>
    <br>
    <b>“My notes” and “Parts” Columns</b><br>
    Because the voice parts can be complex (up to 12 in some songs), the "My
    notes" column has been added to indicate which notes are for your voice
    parts.<br>
    <br>
    <b>View Voice Parts, Adjust “My note” filter</b><br>
    On the page above the table, click "<span style="color: #880000;font-size:11px">View
      Voice Parts, Adjust "My note" filter</span>" to see the voice parts the
    the Directors have assigned you for each song. You can also use this dialog
    to set which notes are checked in the “My note” column, and appear in the My
    Notes filter Preset.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Questions</b><br>
    Use the <span class="rm-button"> ASK QUESTION </span>button to send a
    question to the Note Takers and Directors, and the <span class="rm-button">
      TRACK QUESTIONS </span>button to see the status of questions you’ve
    asked. You cannot edit questions after they have been saved, so if you need
    to make a change, go to the <a href="#singer-ref-track-questions-form">Track
      Questions form</a> and click on the name of the most recent Editor to send
    them an email.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Working offline from a printed copy of the Notes</b><br>
    Use the <span class="rm-button"> PRINT </span>button to bring up a
    printable view of the Rehearsal Notes:
    <ol>
      <li>Select which notes you want to print. Recommend: Presets = "MY NOTES,
        NOT DONE (Rec)".</li>
      <li>Click the <span class="rm-button"> PRINT </span>button.</li>
      <li>Use your browser's Print button to print the page.</li>
      <li><em>Be sure to click the</em> <button class="button rm-button-no-shadow">Set all
          Done</button> <em>button once it is printed!</em>&nbsp;
        This marks the printed notes "Done" and ensures that next time "MY
        NOTES, NOT DONE" will show only changes since the last time you printed.</li>
    </ol>
